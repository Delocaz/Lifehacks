To get rid of small splinters in your finger/palm/anywhere, put glue on the splinter, let it dry, then peel it off. The splinter will come off with the glue! Use sticky tape if you can't wait for it to dry. It won't work if the splinter is completely inside the skin, of course.
If you have a headache, stomach ache, hangover and other things like that, just drink water! You'll be amazed at how many common problems are caused by dehydration.
