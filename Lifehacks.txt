To get rid of small splinters in your finger/palm/anywhere, put glue on the splinter, let it dry, then peel it off. The splinter will come off with the glue! Use sticky tape if you can't wait for it to dry. It won't work if the splinter is completely inside the skin, of course.

If you want to fire up Task Manager on your computer, use Ctrl+Shift+Esc instead of Ctrl+Alt+Del. It will fire up the task manager instantly, skipping the extra menu that is present on some computers. The thing is, Ctrl+Alt+Delete is caught by the kernel, while Ctrl+Shift+Esc is caught by Windows Explorer, so it won't work if your computer is locked up.

If installing applications are blocked on your work computer, use a thumb drive with portable software on it.
Check how much toilet paper there is BEFORE sitting.
